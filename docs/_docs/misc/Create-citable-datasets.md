Create citable datasets or data collections promotes **FAIR**ness (i.e. data that is **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable), which is one of the overarching goals of NIH. ATLAS-D2K provides a mechanism to support citable data collection especially for your up-coming/recent publications. Here is the instruction. 

### 1. Create a citable collection in the ATLAS-D2K site ###
1. Create a collection by following the [submitting collection instruction](/docs/data-collections). Please fill in as much information as you can as some of the attributes as used to issue a DOI ID. As part of the form, set "Required DOI?" to true.   
2. Add all the relevant data involved in your experiment methods or figures in the collection.
3. Edit your collection. Fill in the "Details" section with the content that you want to emphasize to your readers. A common practice is to list images/specimens involved in the figures, so the users can directly get to the high-resolution images or relevant data. 
4. We plan to automate the DOI issuance process, however, this feature is not in the repository yet. In the meantime, **inform us about your collection, and we will manually issue a DOI for your collection**. 

### 2. Create a citation of your dataset in the manuscript 
Follow the [dataset citation convention](https://gudmap.org/about/usage.html) described here. In most cases, it should look like the following:

>[1] Chad V. The GUDMAP Consortium. https://doi.org/10.25548/W-QXXC (2018)

### 3. Reference your data collection in your manuscript 
The dataset citations can be referenced the same was as any other journals or publications in your papers. For example:

>Our dataset [1] shows that ...  


In the methods section, add text that looks something like this:
 
>**Data Dissemination.**
>To increase rigor, reproducibility, and transparency, raw image files and other data generated as part of this study were deposited into the GUDMAP data repository (https://www.gudmap.org) and are fully accessible at https://doi.org/10.25548/W-QXXC (25).
