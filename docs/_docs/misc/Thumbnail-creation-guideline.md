Here is a brief guideline on how to create your thumbnail images.
- General: The thumbnail should highlight the area of interest in your original image. It is usually displayed on the general search page to provide quick impression of the original images.  
- Resolution: Make both the height and width of the thumbnail **150 pixels** (square) and around 72 dpi.
- File format: png or jpg/jpeg (Note: These are browser supported image format)
