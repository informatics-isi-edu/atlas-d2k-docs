## Protected Human Sequencing Data ##
The following sequencing data (fastq and bam) are protected in order to maintain donor privacy. 
- Embryonic human sequencing data
- Consented adult human sequencing data (will be made publicly available soon)

Note: The following data are publicly available 
  - Mouse sequencing data
  - All processed and analysis data (at the replicate or study level)

## Accessing protected sequencing data ##
To access protected human sequencing data: 
1. Send email to help@gudmap.org or help@rebuilidingakidney.org stated your name, research/academic institution, the sequencing studies of interest, and the purposes for using the data. 
2. Subscribe to the [kidney-reader](https://app.globus.org/groups/25ade6a8-6ab6-11e9-9461-0ef301d936cc/about) group. Follow the following instruction on [how to subscribe to a group](/docs/accessing-gudmap-and-rbk-resources).  
3. Once your subscription is approved, you will be able to login to the GUDMAP or RBK to access the [GUDMAP Sequencing Studies](https://www.gudmap.org/chaise/recordset/#2/RNASeq:Study/Consortium=GUDMAP) or [GUDMAP Sequencing Studies](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org/chaise/recordset/#2/RNASeq:Study/Consortium=RBK)  of interest. 
4. There are two ways of download the sequencing data
    * Manually download individual files by clicking on the download button of each file. 
    * Export the sequencing study in bulk. [Click here to see the export instruction](/docs/export-data).
