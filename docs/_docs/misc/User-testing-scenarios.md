# GUDMAP Usage Scenarios

These are organized into related workflows. 

## Gene-centric Scenario

Reading a paper, I come upon a gene that appears to play a role in the cap mesenchyme of the developing kidney. The gene is Six2 and I would like to see what might be informative in the GUDMAP database.

* Is Six2 expression data available from GUDMAP for either mouse or human?
* Refining this information, is this gene expressed in other domains of the developing urogenital system?
* Is there any data that compares the Six2 expression domain to other gene or protein expression patterns?
* The reagents used to generate this data will be useful in my own work. Which antibody should I purchase for my own experiments based on the data I see here?
* What transcriptomic data (RNA-seq or scRNA-seq) is available that may aid in my quest?
* For the human gene, what tools or reagents are available for me to use?

## Cell Population of Interest

Cap mesenchyme is an important cell population in the developing kidney and I want to know more. 

* What other genes are expressed in the cap mesenchyme?
* Are there any transcriptomic datasets that profile the cap mesenchyme?
* Are there any genetic tools available that would be useful to study this cell population?
* Can I get a certain cell line listed?

## Organoids and Profiling

I have a reporter cell line that I would like to differentiate into kidney organoids and profile them using scRNA-seq. 

* Can GUDMAP help me work out the best way to carry out these experiments? 
* Are there antibodies of known markers that are validated to work on organoids?
