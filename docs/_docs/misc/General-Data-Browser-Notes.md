If you are new to using the ATLAS-D2K Data Browser, it will be useful to review the following notes about the interface:

## What is the Data Browser?

When we talk about the Data Browser, we refer to the ATLAS-D2K data repository pages with the blue header saying "ATLAS-D2K Resources" that look like this:

This is where actual data submitted by the ATLAS-D2K projects are shared.

* **ATLAS-D2K share the same Data Browser** which allows for the best inter-linking between both consortiums' data. 

## How do I access the Data Browser?

You may access the Data Browser by going to **either** the [GUDMAP website at beta.gudmap.org](https://beta.gudmap.org) or the [RBK website at www.rebuildingakidney.org](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org) and clicking the data links under the _Resources_ menu item.

There are also links on the homepages of both websites that link into the Data Browser.

## Interface overview

### Navigation Header

### Filtering sidebar

### Selection menus

Most of our data entry forms will include menus from which you'll choose from pre-defined values.

* Clicking on `Select a value` will pop up a new window with selection options.
* Click the checkmark on the left of an option to select it.
* Click anywhere else in a row to see more information about that option.
* If none of the existing options is what you want, you may add a new one by clicking the `+` sign in the upper right-hand corner of the popup window.

### Bulk add

In certain forms, you have the option of clicking the `+` sign to copy the form horizontally across the screen. Each time you click `+`, another form is added.

## How do I submit data to the Data Browser?

First, if you haven't already done so, **you must ask to join the `kidney-writers` authentication group**: [https://app.globus.org/groups/af0b4010-5b75-11e6-9575-22000aef184d/about](https://app.globus.org/groups/af0b4010-5b75-11e6-9575-22000aef184d/about)

Once you are approved, you will be able to login to the Data Browser with editing access. You can find more details about this process at [Accessing ATLAS-D2K Resources](/docs/accessing-gudmap-and-rbk-resources).

You can find instructions for submitting  for how to submit, edit, even delete data from the Data Browser per data types below or in the wiki sidebar to your right:

* [Submitting Sequencing Data](/docs/submitting-sequencing-data-v3)
* [Submitting Protocols](/docs/protocols)
* [Submitting Antibodies](/docs/antibodies)
