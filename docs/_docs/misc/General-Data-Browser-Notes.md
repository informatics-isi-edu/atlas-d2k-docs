If you are new to using the ATLAS-D2K Data Browser, it will be useful to review the following notes about the interface:

## What is the Data Browser?

When we talk about the Data Browser, we refer to the ATLAS-D2K data repository pages with the blue header saying "ATLAS-D2K Resources" that look like this:

![Screenshot of typical Data Browser header]({{ "/assets/wiki_images/submitting-data/data-browser-header.png" | relative_url }})

This is where actual data submitted by the ATLAS-D2K projects are shared.

## How do I access the Data Browser?

You may access the Data Browser by going to the [ATLAS-D2K website at www.atlas-d2k.org](https://www.atlas-d2k.org) and clicking the links under the _Data_ top-level menu item or use the shortcut links on the homepage.

There are also links on the homepages of both websites that link into the Data Browser.

## Interface overview

### Navigation Header

### Filtering sidebar

### Selection menus

Most of our data entry forms will include menus from which you'll choose from pre-defined values.

* Clicking on `Select a value` will pop up a new window with selection options.
* Click the checkmark on the left of an option to select it.
* Click anywhere else in a row to see more information about that option.
* If none of the existing options is what you want, you may add a new one by clicking the `+` sign in the upper right-hand corner of the popup window.

### Bulk add

In certain forms, you have the option of clicking the `+` sign to copy the form horizontally across the screen. Each time you click `+`, another form is added.
