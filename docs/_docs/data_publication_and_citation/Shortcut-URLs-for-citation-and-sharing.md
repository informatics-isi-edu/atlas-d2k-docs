The ATLAS-D2K data browser allows you to use "shortcut" URLs for easier (and better-looking) citation and sharing of any ATLAS-D2K record.

To use, make note of the RID for the record you want to cite or share. For example, if you want to share Steve Potter's protocol for ["Psychrophilic (Cold) protease dissociation of mouse kidney"](https://www.rebuildingakidney.org/chaise/record/#2/Protocol:Protocol/RID=N-H9DA), you would note the code in the *RID* field or column: **N-H9DA**.

To create the new URL, just use the following format:

> https://www.gudmap.org/id/<RID\>

Which in this case would be:

> https://www.gudmap.org/id/N-H9DA

**Note:** The URL must use `https://` and not `http://` or the link will not work.
