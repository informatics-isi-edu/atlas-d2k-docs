Here is the guideline on how to aggregate your datasets to have it properly cited in your publications. 

### Creation a collection

You can find complete documentation for [creating a data collection here](Submitting-Data-Collections). In general, you will:

1. A collection is used to gather all the relevant data involved in your publication. So first [create a collection](https://www.gudmap.org/chaise/recordedit/#2/Common:Collection) and fill in all the metadata (e.g. title, description) associated with the collection. A Digital Object ID (DOI) may be generated for each data collection and can used for citation. Be sure to fill in all the metadata as they are required to mint a DOI. Check the tooltips associated with each field for more information. See an example of [a collection](https://doi.org/10.25548/R-ZD44) used in McMahon JASN 2018 paper.
2. Add all the existing data to the collection.
3. Release your data collection by changing the Curation Status to "Release". You will also need to make sure that the Curation Status associated with the relevant data in your collection are marked as "Release". Please note that only "Release" records will be available to the public. 
 
### Cite your data collection in the manuscript

We recommend linking to these as both a reference and in the Methods section.

#### Citing as a reference

Use the following convention: `<PI Name>` GUDMAP Consortium. `<DOI ID>` (`<year>`)

  - `<PI Name>` is the name of the principal investigator e.g., McMahon, A. 
  - `<DOI ID>` is the DOI ID generated for your collection 
  - `<year>` is the year of the publication 

Example: McMahon, A. GUDMAP Consortium. https://doi.org/10.25548/R-ZD44 (2017)

Note: the above convention follows the scientific data citation based on [the Nature site](http://blogs.nature.com/scientificdata/2016/07/14/data-citations-at-scientific-data/)

#### Citing in the Methods section

In the appropriate section of the paper (usually the Methods section), add the DOI link to the data collection. You can use the following example paragraph as a reference for writing your own:

> To increase rigor and reproducibility, the raw sequencing data as well as analysis files generated as part of this study were uploaded into the (Re)Buildingakidney (RBK) consortium database and are fully accessible at https://doi.org/10.25548/16-E08W [1].  

Where [1] is the reference number of the dataset in 1.
