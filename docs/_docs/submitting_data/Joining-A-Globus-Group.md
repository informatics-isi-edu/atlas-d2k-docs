You will need to be in the appropriate Globus group for editing access or in some cases read-only access to unreleased records. Please email the ATLAS-D2K Center at [help@atlas-d2k.org](mailto:help@atlas-d2k.org) to ask for help joining the correct group.

To join a Globus group:

* Go to the link provided by the ATLAS-D2K Center and choose your preferred method of logging in.

    - You can use your institution’s credentials by searching your institution’s name in the search field. You can also use Google or ORCID to sign in.
    - If none of the above options are available to you,  click where it says "Then use Globus ID to sign in." to choose your own username/password and follow the instructions.

* Request group membership: Once you’ve signed in, click the  “Join Group” button (towards the right side of the page) to request membership.

A member of the ATLAS-D2K Center will approve your request and you will receive an email notification.
