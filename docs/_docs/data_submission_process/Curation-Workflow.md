## Curation Status Breakdown

The following status codes apply when you are editing and submitting your data:

| Use this Curation Status: | When you are:                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _In Preparation_            | Still working on your data submission (this is the default). Not viewable by the public.                            |
| _PI Review_                 | Ready for your PI (or designated reviewer) to review and approve your work. Not viewable by the public.             |
| _Submitted_                 | Ready for the Hub/Biocurator to review it. Not viewable by the public. |

The following status codes apply once the Hub starts reviewing your data until it is finally visible to the public:

| This Curation Status: | Means:                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Hub Attention_            | Initial review by the Hub - for protocols, this usually means a triage to see if anything major is missing or confusing.   |
| _Biocurator Review_  | For more complex data, the Biocurator reviews to make sure the data is correct and that there are enough fields filled out so that is more easily discoverable in the Data Browser.             |
| _Amendment_                 | Something has been flagged by the Hub or Biocurator and they are working with the project to amend the data |
| _Released_                 | Everything checks out and **the data is now visible by the public**. |
