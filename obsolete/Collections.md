[Data collections](https://www.atlas-d2k.org/chaise/recordset/#2/Common:Collection) are a curated set of GUDMAP data collected into one easily citable and referenced location with a permanent identifier (DOI), usually for the purposes of:

- A publication. A collection can consolidate all of the source data related to a paper - not just the low resolution images available within a paper. Readers can unambiguously obtain full quality, source data that was referenced in the paper, which translates to repeatable experiments.
- A collaboration between multiple projects. A data collection can help ensure that all parties are working with the exact same data and protocols.

**If you are a GUDMAP project publishing a paper**, please:
- [Create and reference a “Data Collection”](../create-citable-datasets/) for data included in your paper and any additional data you wish to be considered relevant to the published project.
- Refer to [Citing GUDMAP](https://www.atlas-d2k.org/gudmap/citing-gudmap/) to learn how to add your data citation in the bibliography section, and how to cite your data collection in the manuscript.
